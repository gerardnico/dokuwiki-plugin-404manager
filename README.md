# dokuwiki-plugin-404manager [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gerardnico/dokuwiki-plugin-404manager.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gerardnico/dokuwiki-plugin-404manager)

## About

The [404 manager Dokuwiki plugin](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:404manager) changes the behavior of Dokuwiki when a page doesn't exist.

On a normal website, when a page doesn't exist, you get an [hard HTTP 404 response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404), hence the name of the plugin.
Dokuwiki returns a soft 404 with this simple message : 'This topic does not exist yet'.

As you can see below on this snapshot:

![The illustration](https://github.com/gerardnico/dokuwiki-plugin-404manager/blob/master/images/dokuwiki_200.jpg "Dokuwiki This topic does not exist yet")

For the website readers, it's not really helpful and it can occur frequently when you use intensively the [plugin pagemove](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:pagemove)
in order to move page around. The most important problem is that thus external links become obsolete (especially for search engine for instance).

## What can this plugin do ?

### For writers
  * Automatic redirection in edit mode
  * A message is shown when the page name already exist in other pages.

**Example:**

![The page name check message](https://github.com/gerardnico/dokuwiki-plugin-404manager/blob/master/images/404manager_check_page_name_message.png)


### For readers

  * Redirection to a target page for a source page with the admin page
  * Redirection by to the start page of the same namespace
  * Redirection by best namespace
  * Redirection to the internal search engine
  * and of course Nothing.



## Installation

Install the plugin using:

  * the [Plugin Manager](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:plugin)
  * [manually](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:Plugins) with the [download URL](http://github.com/gerardnico/dokuwiki-plugin-minimap/zipball/master), which points to latest version of the plugin.
  
on a server with minimal php 7.1

## Configuration settings

You can configure the 404 Manager Plugin in the Configuration settings admin page.

![404manager configruation settings](https://github.com/gerardnico/dokuwiki-plugin-404manager/blob/master/images/dokuwiki_404manager_conf.jpg)

You can :
  * choose which action you want to perform for a reader (if the first action don't find any target page, the 404Manager plugin go to the second action, ...)
  * set that a writer switch directly to the edit mode
  * set if you want to check if the name page is unique
  * set if you want to see the classic message. A classic message is a message that the user don't need to understand what happened. The 404 Manager have only one classic message and it's when a redirection to the edit mode occur for a writer)
  * set the weight factor for the [Redirection by best namepage](#redirection-by-best-namepage)


## Settings explained
### Redirection by configuration (Admin Page)

To go to the admin page, click on the admin button in the bottom of your page and click on the 404 Manager Plugin link.

![404manager in the admin page](https://github.com/gerardnico/dokuwiki-plugin-404manager/blob/master/images/dokuwiki_404manager_adminpage_list.jpg)

You will see the admin page for the 404 Manager Plugin. This page allow you to set up redirects to internal pages as external websites.

![404manager plugin admin page](https://github.com/gerardnico/dokuwiki-plugin-404manager/blob/master/images/dokuwiki_404manager_adminpage.jpg)

Action, you can perform :
  * Add/Modify a redirect with the form Add/Modify
  * Delete a redirect with the picture "delete"


### Redirection by best name page

The redirection by best name page is an simple algorithm which occurs to find the best page by name.

It calculate a score for two kinds of page :

  * the start pages of a namespace
  * the pages with the same name

A weight factor is applied and in this way, you can influence the redirection :

  * When a page have the same name (by default 4)
  * When a page is a start page of a namespace (by default 3)
  * When a namespace match (by default 5)

To change the default configuration, you must go to the [configuration settings](#configuration settings) page

#### Example

  * The page asked : namespace1:namespace2:pagename
  * We have one page with the same name : namespace1:pagename
  * We have one startpage : namespace1:namespace2:start

**Score :**
  * The score for the page with the same name is : 9 = 5 (because namespace1 is present in the asked page) + 4 (because the page name match)
  * The score for the startpage is : 13 = 5 (because namespace1 is present in the asked page) + 5 (because namespace2 is present in the asked page) + 3 (because it's a start page)

In this case, the startpage is the redirect page because it have a highest score (13 against 9)

### Redirection by best namespace
This redirection perform the same algorithm that the [redirection by best namepage](#Redirection by best namepage) but only for the start pages. If two start page for a namespace have the same score, the smallest start page is fired.

**Ex:**
  * asked page : namespace1:namespace3:namepage
  * first start page : namespace1:namespace2:start (Score 5 = 2 for namespace1 + 3 for the startpage)
  * second start page : namespace1:start (Score 5 = 2 for namespace1 + 3 for the startpage)
We have the same score and the redirection occur on the smallest start page : first start page.

### Redirection to the intern search engine
The 404 Manager redirects to the search engine.

The query performed is an explode of the page asked.

#### Example

  * The page asked : namespace1:namespace2:pre_pagename
  * The query asked : namespace1+namespace2+pre+pagename


## Data Store

You can find the meta data:
  * for the last version: in the Sqlite Database DOKUWIKI_HOME/data/meta/404manager.sqlite3
  * for the older version: in the file 404managerRedirect.conf or 404managerRedirect.conf.migrated in the directory DOKUWIKI_HOME\lib\plugins\404manager

With the SQLite plugin, the data can be queried directly through its admin page.

Example: 

  * All redirections from the last 5 minutes:

```sql
select 
  * 
from 
  redirections_log 
where 
  datetime(timestamp) > datetime('now','-5 minutes')
order by 
  datetime(timestamp) desc;
```

  * Count of redirections by minutes

```sql
select 
  strftime('%H:%M', timestamp), 
  count(1) 
from 
  redirections_log 
group by 
  strftime('%H:%M', timestamp)
```

## Language
The plugin is only translated in English but you can translate it in your own language.

Just copy the directory [lang/en](lang/en), rename it in your own language (For instance, for france, to lang/fr) and translate the files.


## FMI

[URL move for Google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7238431) Use 302 redirects, not 301 redirects 
```text
If you’re running an A/B test that redirects users from the original URL to a variation URL, 
use a 302 (temporary) redirect, not a 301 (permanent) redirect. 
This tells search engines that this redirect is temporary—it will only be in place as long as you’re running the experiment—and that they should keep the original URL in their index rather than replacing it with the target of the redirect (the test page). 
JavaScript-based redirects are also fine.
```
